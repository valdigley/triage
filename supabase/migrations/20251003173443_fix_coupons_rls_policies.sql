/*
  # Fix RLS Policies for triagem_coupons

  1. Changes
    - Drop existing policies that use complex subqueries with auth.users
    - Create simpler policies for reading and managing coupons
  
  2. Security
    - All authenticated users can read active coupons (needed for validation)
    - Only users with admin role in tenant_users can manage coupons
*/
